    GAME INTRO:<br><br>
    This game is part of Surviving Suburbia, a series of artworks discussing the cost of the American-style Suburbia.<br><br>
    The game, The Suburbian Dilemma, introduces the idea of Growth Ponzi Scheme in urban planning
to the gamers in the most intuitive way. <br><br>
    Gamers are playing as an urban planner leading the development of new spaces in our city of Rochester. Gamers need to try their best to
      help Rochester stay financially solvent. The game ends when Rochester goes in debt (known as bankruptcy in the game).<br><br>
      The game is a mini-simulator of the American city development cycle. It might not be clear about what's going on in your first
       playthough. However, after watching the videos linked inside the game explaining the concept of Growth Ponzi Scheme, the game should be 
      straightforward.<br><br><br>
